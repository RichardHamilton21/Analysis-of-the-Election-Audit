Election-Audit Summary:
This script could be easily modified to be used for any election and the results would be able to be organized and seen with the press of a button.  For an example maybe the data is given in a different order.  All that would need be done is to change the column that is being pulled from by changing the index.  The path could be easily changed to pull from other data sources and the output can be easily changed to show any number of results.
